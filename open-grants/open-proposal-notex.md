# Project Description

NoTex.ch is a *value neutral* **censorship resistant** blogging platform. It provides an easy to use editor with advanced features, allowing technically unsophisticated folks to write Markdown based blog posts.

It facilitates IPFS as a single-click publishing platform, and allows also to certify each and every blog post via ERC-721 NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) on Ethereum compatible blockchains, where IFPS is again used as a storage layer for NFT metadata.

While an MVP is already up and running, NoTex.ch lacks advanced features of comparable platforms like Medium, e.g. project management, cross-browser persistence, post outlining, commenting, collaborative sharing, social features, automated pinning, branding, documentation, and also a build-in tokenized economics, which all need to be addressed step-by-step.

## Value

- What are the benefits to getting this right?

Uncompromisable freedom of speech.

- What are the risks if you don't get it right?

Producing yet another blogging platform, dominated by whoever is willing to pay the most.

- What are the risks that will make executing on this project difficult?

Politically: essentially "nation state sovereignty"; economically: slow progress due to funding; technologically: none, except that IPFS itself might somehow get banned / blocked / censored (unlikely).

## Deliverables

A website running NoTex.ch with the option of using IPFS as a delivery platform itself, instead of relying on centralized service providers.

## Maintenance and Upgrade Plans

NoTex.ch has been a personal side effort of mine since almost 10 years, and I'll maintain and upgrade this project as long as I'm professionally able to do so. However, I do want to turn this endeavour of mine into a self sustaining project, and also accelerate and professionalize it, without losing sight of the vision -- which is to provide a venue for people to freely (and possibly anonymously) express themselves, where token economics shall play an important role.
